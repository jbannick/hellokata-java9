These Kata are specific to coding features introduced with Java 9.

Specifically, they address:

Modularization
Multi-Version JARs
Custom Runtime Images

They are all compiled on my Mac under Java 9,
except for the Multi-Version parts that are compiled under other Java releases.

Custom Runtime Images have been run on my Mac, Linux, and Windows boxes.

They require JDKs for Linux and Windows and for other Java releases.
